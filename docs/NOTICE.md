## AI Content Notice

This project was developed almost exclusively using the AI integration tools by JetBrains s.r.o. in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Acknowledgments

1. This extension is **heavily** based on and inspired by [Jacques Lucke's blender_vscode](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/blender_vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code. Some of the core functions are pulled directly from his extension, including:
   - Extension repository management.
   - Communication between Blender and PyCharm.
   - Robust reload cycle.
   - New Project Wizard (integrated into PyCharm's New Project Wizard).

2. The initial versions of this project were developed using JetBrains' AI tools, specifically Junie, which wrote a significant portion of the code and documentation.
