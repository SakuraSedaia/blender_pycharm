# Welcome to the Blender Dev Tools for PyCharm Wiki

Integrated Blender dev tools directly into your PyCharm workflow. This plugin provides a comprehensive suite of tools to streamline the creation, testing, and deployment of Blender extensions.

The Hot-Swapping Protocol and Auto-load bootstrap is lifted almost directly from the [Blender Development extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/blender_vscode) by Jacques Lucke and adapted for use in PyCharm with the software's more robust Python development tools.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to provide a first-class development experience for Blender Extensions (4.2+) within PyCharm/IntelliJ, including reliable hot-reloading and seamless project management.

## Getting Started
